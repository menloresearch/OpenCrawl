# Research Results: how do auto regressive transformers work?

Auto-regressive transformers, also known as autoregressive transformer models, are a type of transformer architecture that uses a decoder-only structure to generate output in a step-by-step, word-by-word fashion (Source 3). This means that they predict the next word in a sequence based on the previous words, making them suitable for tasks that require sequential generation of text, such as text summarization, language translation, and other language-related tasks (Source 3, Source 9).

The core architecture of auto-regressive transformers relies on the self-attention mechanism, which allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence and capture the context and relationships between them (Source 2, Source 4). However, unlike traditional transformer models that use both an encoder and a decoder, auto-regressive transformers use only the decoder part, which enables them to generate output sequentially (Source 3, Source 5).

The auto-regressive nature of these models means that they rely on the previous output to generate the next one, making them similar to traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in terms of their sequential processing approach (Source 10, Source 11). However, unlike RNNs, auto-regressive transformers use self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies and context, which makes them more efficient and effective in handling longer sequences (Source 8, Source 9).

One of the key advantages of auto-regressive transformers is their ability to handle sequential data and generate high-quality text outputs (Source 3, Source 9). They have been used in a variety of natural language processing tasks, including language translation, text summarization, and text generation (Source 3, Source 7).

However, auto-regressive transformers also face challenges in terms of processing speed due to their sequential data handling (Source 3). This can make them less efficient than other transformer models that use parallel processing, such as the Transformer-XL or the Reformer (Source 1).

In recent years, there have been advancements in the development of auto-regressive transformers, including the use of linear attention mechanisms, which can simplify the self-attention process and make autoregressive models more practical (Source 12). These advancements have improved the efficiency and performance of auto-regressive transformers, making them a popular choice for a variety of natural language processing tasks.

In summary, auto-regressive transformers are a type of transformer architecture that uses a decoder-only structure to generate output in a step-by-step, word-by-word fashion. They rely on self-attention mechanisms to capture context and relationships between words and use a sequential processing approach to generate output. While they face challenges in terms of processing speed, they have been used in a variety of natural language processing tasks and have shown promising results.
